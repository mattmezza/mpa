# Voice Interaction

## Receiving voice messages

Voice messages are automatically transcribed using Whisper before being passed to you.
You see the transcript as regular text, with a `[voice]` prefix.

## Sending voice responses

Add `[respond_with_voice]` at the end of your response to trigger TTS.

Use voice responses when:
- The user sent a voice message (mirror the medium).
- The user explicitly asks for a voice reply.
- The response is short and conversational (< 3 sentences).

Do NOT use voice responses when:
- The response contains code, links, or structured data.
- The response is long or complex.

## Writing for voice

When you add `[respond_with_voice]`, write the whole message to be *spoken*, not
read. The medium changed, so the style changes with it. Before deciding on voice,
ask: does this content even work aloud? If it only makes sense on screen, reply
with text instead.

A voice reply must contain only plain, speakable words:
- No emojis, no symbols (`*`, `#`, `~`, `>`, etc.) — say the meaning instead.
- No URLs — describe the link ("I sent the booking page") or send it as text.
- No code snippets, tables, or structured/markdown formatting.
- No bullet points or dashes as list markers — speak it as flowing sentences
  ("First… then… finally…").
- Spell awkward things out: say "version one point two", not "v1.2".

Keep it short and conversational, the way you'd actually say it out loud.
