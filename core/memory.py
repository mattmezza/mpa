_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = """\
You are reviewing short-term memories stored by a personal AI assistant.
Your job is to decide which short-term memories contain facts worth keeping
permanently, and compact them into long-term memories.

## Existing long-term memories (for deduplication)
{existing_long_term}

## Short-term memories to review
{short_term_entries}

For each short-term memory, decide:
1. PROMOTE — the fact is durable and worth keeping. Compact it aggressively
   into a short, dense long-term memory. Strip dates, times, and situational
   framing. Keep only the core fact.
   Examples:
   - "Matteo is at the airport, flight to Rome boards at 15:40" → discard (ephemeral)
   - "Matteo mentioned he has a standing lunch with Marco every Friday" → promote: \
"Has a standing Friday lunch with Marco"
   - "Simge is visiting her parents this weekend" → discard (time-bound)
   - "Matteo said he switched to a standing desk at work" → promote: \
"Uses a standing desk at work"
2. DISCARD — the fact is time-bound, stale, or already captured in long-term memory.

Return a JSON array of objects to promote. Each object:
  {{"category": "<category>", "subject": "<who/what>", \
"content": "<compacted fact>"}}

Categories: preference, relationship, fact, routine, work, health, travel

Rules:
- Be ruthless. Most short-term memories should be discarded.
- Only promote facts that would still be useful weeks or months from now.
- Compact aggressively: strip temporal context, keep the core fact.
- Do NOT promote anything that duplicates or overlaps with existing long-term memories.
- If a short-term memory refines or updates an existing long-term memory,
  promote it with the updated content (it will replace the old one).
- Use lowercase for subject (e.g. "matteo", "simge").
- If nothing is worth promoting, return an empty array: []

Respond with ONLY the JSON array, no other text."""

_UPDATE_PROMPT = """\
You maintain the long-term memory of a personal AI assistant. Decide what to do
with a new candidate fact relative to the existing memories it most resembles.

Today's date: {today}

## Candidate fact
[{category}] {subject}: {content}

## Existing related memories
{existing}

Choose exactly ONE operation:
- ADD — the candidate is genuinely new information not already covered above.
- UPDATE — the candidate refines, corrects, or re-words ONE existing memory.
  Give its id and the final merged content to keep (prefer the newer fact on
  conflict; keep it short and dense).
- DELETE — the candidate states that an existing memory is no longer true, and
  there is nothing worth keeping in its place. Give the id to remove.
- NOOP — the candidate duplicates an existing memory, or is not worth keeping.

Keep long-term memories short and dense: strip dates, times, and situational
framing. Use lowercase for subject.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no other text. One of:
  {{"operation": "ADD"}}
  {{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": <id>, "category": "<cat>", \
"subject": "<subj>", "content": "<merged fact>"}}

Resolve the cluster into the minimal set of correct, non-redundant memories:
- Merge duplicates and overlapping facts into one, keeping the clearest wording.
- On contradictions, keep the most recent fact and drop the stale one.
- Keep each memory short and dense (strip dates, times, situational framing).

Return ONLY a JSON object describing the changes to apply:
  {{"updates": [{{"id": <id>, "category": "<cat>", "subject": "<subj>", \
"content": "<merged fact>"}}],
   "deletes": [<id>, <id>]}}

- Put the surviving memory in "updates" (reuse one of the cluster ids), with the
  final merged content.
- Put every other id in the cluster that should be removed in "deletes".

_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """\
Given this conversation exchange, identify any facts worth remembering.

User: {user_msg}
Assistant: {agent_msg}

For each fact, classify it into ONE of these tiers:

LONG_TERM — durable facts that remain true indefinitely:
  - Personal preferences ("prefers oat milk", "favourite editor is Neovim")
  - Relationships ("Marco is Matteo's colleague", "Simge is Matteo's partner")
  - Biographical facts ("lives in Zurich", "works as a software engineer")
  - Routines ("goes to the gym on Mondays and Thursdays")
  DO NOT use LONG_TERM for:
  - Plans, tasks, or events (even recurring ones that haven't been confirmed as routines)
  - Anything time-bound ("working on project X", "has a deadline Friday")
  - Opinions about transient topics ("thinks the new API is buggy")

SHORT_TERM — situational context that expires:
  - Current activities ("working from home today", "debugging the auth flow")
  - Near-term plans ("dinner with Marco tomorrow", "flight to Rome on Friday")
  - Temporary states ("feeling tired", "waiting for a code review")
  - Active projects or tasks ("refactoring the memory system this week")

When in doubt between LONG_TERM and SHORT_TERM, choose SHORT_TERM. Only use
LONG_TERM for facts you are highly confident will still be true months from now.
{scope_block}
Return a JSON array (max 3 items). Each element must be one of:
  {{"tier": "LONG_TERM", "category": "<category>", \
"subject": "<who/what>", "content": "<the fact>"}}
  {{"tier": "SHORT_TERM", "content": "<the fact>", \
"context": "<why stored>", "ttl_hours": <int>}}

Categories: preference, relationship, fact, routine, work, health, travel

Rules:
- Extract only genuinely useful, non-obvious facts. Skip greetings, filler,
  acknowledgements, and anything already obvious from the conversation.
- Most conversation turns contain NOTHING worth remembering. Return [] liberally.
- Do NOT extract facts that duplicate or overlap with the existing memories
  listed above.
- Use lowercase for subject (e.g. "matteo", "simge").
- For LONG_TERM, always set category and subject.
- For SHORT_TERM, you MUST set ttl_hours:
  - 2-4h: trivial, task-at-hand context ("looking at flights now")
  - 8-12h: day-scoped situations ("working from home today")
  - 24-48h: near-term plans ("dinner with Marco tomorrow")
