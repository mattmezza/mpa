        preventing context leakage across chats.

        ``persona_name`` forces the identity instead of resolving it from the

        yet still sees them as inbound turns when it is later addressed. No
        persona, preamble, or LLM call runs on this path.

        ``addressed`` is whether the message was explicitly directed at THIS bot

        diverges when ``reply_when_addressed_only=False`` makes a bot reply to
        everything — there ``respond`` is True for unaddressed messages too. The
        YOLO toggle keys off ``addressed`` (not ``respond``) so a bare ``/yolo-on``
        never flips every bot in a room. Defaults True for non-group channels.

        ``message_id`` is the inbound message's id, carried into request_state so
        the ``set_reaction`` tool can react to the triggering message without the
        model having to know its id (#70). Channel-specific; None off Telegram.
