"""Subagents — scoped sub-loops the main agent can delegate to (issue #15).

A *subagent* is one execution primitive (``AgentCore.run_subagent``) reached by
two trigger paths: on demand via the ``spawn_subagent`` tool, or on a schedule
via a ``subagent`` job. Either way it runs the existing agent loop with **system
semantics** (no goal decomposition / memory / reflection / approval prompts) and
a agent whose tool/skill/secret scope is a *subset* of the caller's — never
wider (``narrow_scope``).

This module holds only the lifecycle bookkeeping: a small in-memory registry of
runs so list / status / cancel work from Telegram and the admin UI. Runs are
ephemeral (an ``asyncio`` task each) — a restart kills them, so an in-memory
registry is the right scope; nothing here needs to survive a reboot.
