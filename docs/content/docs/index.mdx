# MPA — My Personal Agent

MPA is a self-hosted personal AI agent that runs in a single Docker container. It acts as a unified interface across messaging channels, email, calendars, and contacts — capable of autonomous action, scheduled tasks, voice interaction, and persistent memory.

## Why MPA?

Most AI assistants are cloud-hosted black boxes with limited integrations. MPA takes a different approach:

- **Self-hosted** — runs on your own server, your data stays with you
- **Single container** — one `docker compose up` and you're running
- **Extensible without code** — teach the agent new capabilities by writing markdown files
- **Multi-channel** — Telegram, WhatsApp, email, calendar, all through one agent
- **Persistent memory** — the agent remembers facts about you and your contacts
- **Proactive** — scheduled tasks for morning briefings, email monitoring, and more

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Messaging** | Telegram and WhatsApp with text and voice messages |
| **Email** | Read, compose, and manage emails via [Himalaya](https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya) CLI |
| **Calendar** | CalDAV integration (Google Calendar, iCloud, etc.) |
| **Contacts** | CardDAV providers via the built-in contacts CLI |
| **Memory** | Two-tier system: permanent long-term facts and expiring short-term context |
| **Scheduled tasks** | Cron-based jobs for briefings, email checks, and custom tasks |
| **Voice** | Speech-to-text (faster-whisper) and text-to-speech (edge-tts) |
| **Web search** | Tavily integration for real-time information |
| **Permissions** | Glob-pattern rules with interactive Telegram approval |
| **Admin UI** | Web dashboard for configuration, skills editing, memory, and more |
| **Skills** | Markdown-based capability system — no code required |
| **Setup wizard** | Step-by-step first-boot configuration via the admin UI |

## How it works

MPA follows a **Python orchestrator + CLI tools** design. Python glues everything together, while battle-tested CLI tools handle protocol complexity:

| Concern | Tool |
|---------|------|
| LLM | Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Grok (xAI), Google, DeepSeek |
| Email | Himalaya CLI (Rust) |
| Contacts | Built-in contacts CLI |
| Calendar | python-caldav |
| Storage | SQLite (multiple databases) |
| Voice | faster-whisper (STT) + edge-tts (TTS) |
| Admin UI | FastAPI + HTMX + Tailwind CSS |

Instead of hardcoded integrations, the agent learns to use CLI tools via markdown "skill" files. Adding a new capability means writing a markdown file and adding the tool's command prefix to the executor whitelist.
