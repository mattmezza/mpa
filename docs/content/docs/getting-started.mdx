# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended), or Python 3.14+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (or OpenAI, Grok, Google, DeepSeek)
- A [Telegram bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)

## Quick start with Docker

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattmezza/mpa.git
cd mpa
cp .env.example .env
cp config.yml.example config.yml
cp character.md.example character.md
cp personalia.md.example personalia.md
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys and secrets. Edit `config.yml` to customize the agent name, owner, channels, and scheduled jobs.

### 2. Start the agent

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The admin UI will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. On first boot, MPA starts in **setup mode** — a wizard walks you through the initial configuration.

### 3. Talk to your agent

Open Telegram and start chatting with your bot. Try:

```
Check my emails
What's on my calendar today?
Remember that I prefer oat milk
```

## Running without Docker

Requires Python 3.14+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
make setup       # creates venv, installs deps, copies example configs
```

Edit `.env` and `config.yml`, then:

```bash
make run         # starts the agent
```

## Setup wizard

On first boot, the admin UI presents a step-by-step wizard:

1. **Welcome** — overview and getting started
2. **Identity** — agent name and owner name
3. **LLM** — provider and API key configuration
4. **Telegram** — bot token and allowed user IDs
5. **WhatsApp** — optional WhatsApp channel setup
6. **Email** — Himalaya configuration for email accounts
7. **Calendar** — CalDAV provider setup
8. **Search** — Tavily API key for web search
9. **Admin** — admin API key and port
10. **Done** — configuration saved, agent starts

After setup, all configuration is managed through the admin UI or `config.yml`.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | API keys and secrets |
| `config.yml` | Agent settings, channels, calendar, scheduler jobs |
| `character.md` | Agent personality and communication style (editable) |
| `personalia.md` | Agent identity facts — name, owner, context (append-only) |
| `skills/*.md` | Skill documents that teach the agent how to use tools |
