# Admin UI

MPA includes a web-based admin interface built with FastAPI, HTMX, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a dark, terminal-aesthetic dashboard for managing every aspect of your agent.

## Access

The admin UI runs on the configured port (default 8000):

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Authentication uses a Bearer token (the `ADMIN_API_KEY` from your config).

## Sections

### Dashboard

Overview of agent status, active channels, and quick stats.

### Configuration

Edit agent settings without touching config files:

- **Identity** — agent name and owner name
- **LLM** — provider, model, and API key configuration
- **Channels** — enable/disable Telegram and WhatsApp
- **Calendar** — manage CalDAV providers
- **Contacts** — manage contact providers
- **Email** — Himalaya configuration
- **Search** — Tavily API configuration
- **Voice** — STT/TTS settings

### Skills

Built-in skill editor for creating, editing, and deleting skill files. Changes take effect immediately — no restart needed.

### Memory

Inspect and manage the agent's memories:

- View all long-term memories by category
- View active short-term context
- Delete individual memories
- Trigger manual memory consolidation

### Permissions

View, add, edit, and delete permission rules. See current glob patterns and their levels (ALWAYS / ASK / NEVER).

### Jobs

Manage scheduled tasks:

- View all registered jobs with their cron expressions
- Create new jobs
- Pause/resume jobs
- Delete jobs
- View job execution history

### History

Browse conversation history across channels. View individual conversation turns with tool call details.

### Logs

Real-time log viewer for debugging and monitoring agent behavior.

## Setup wizard

On first boot, the admin UI presents a step-by-step setup wizard:

1. **Welcome** — overview
2. **Identity** — name the agent and set the owner
3. **LLM** — choose provider and enter API key
4. **Telegram** — configure bot token and allowed users
5. **WhatsApp** — optional WhatsApp setup
6. **Email** — configure email accounts
7. **Calendar** — set up CalDAV providers
8. **Search** — configure web search
9. **Admin** — set admin API key
10. **Done** — save and start

The wizard writes to the SQLite config store, which becomes the source of truth after setup.

## Tech stack

The admin UI is built with a pragmatic, server-rendered approach:

- **FastAPI** — Python web framework with async support
- **Jinja2** — server-side HTML templating
- **HTMX** — dynamic updates without writing JavaScript
- **Alpine.js** — lightweight reactive UI where needed
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first dark-themed styling

## Configuration

```yaml
admin:
  enabled: true
  port: 8000
  api_key: "${ADMIN_API_KEY}"
```
